           1.2: it provides a possibility for peripheral communication and
                overall security of the computer system.
           1.3: to have software applications and GUI already provided by the OS,
                so that you don't have to implement these applications and elements
                yourself, you can just state their existence.
           1.4: logical memory is the address space, assigned to a logical partition,
                that the operating system perceives as its main storage.
           1.5: virtual memory is a section of volatile memory created temporarily
                on the storage drive. It is created when a computer is running many
                processes at once and RAM is running low.
           1.6: As the number of bits composing a string increases, the number of
                possible 0 and 1 combinations increases exponentially, so 6 bits
                can represent 2^6 = 64
                Or, 2^n where n is the number of bits used.
          1.7: a system call is a request from computer software to an operating
                system's kernel. The kernel is a computer program at the core of
                a computer's operating system and has complete control over
                everything in the system.

            2.2: 1100110 base 2 is 66 in hexadecimal
            2.3: 8C2A base 16 is 1000110000101010 in binary
